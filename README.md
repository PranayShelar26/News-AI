News AI

This is a React.js and Bootstrap based news aggregator app designed to keep you updated with the latest news. I developed this project with the following key features:

Infinite Scroll: Seamlessly load more news articles as you scroll down, providing a smooth and uninterrupted reading experience.
Loader: A dynamic loader to indicate data fetching, enhancing user experience.
Browser Routing: Navigate effortlessly between different pages using browser routes.
News API Integration: The app fetches real-time news data from the News API. However, please note that the API does not provide images for the news articles.
Feel free to explore and contribute!
